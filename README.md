# Fetch Frontend Exercise Submission - Tanmay Jena

Here's the link to the documentation of my application: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kONJJ_nSX5rreBBO1d6jV4IeoHjfhw_aoC8kFh7_23A/edit?usp=sharing

The document contains the instructions to run the code locally, the link to this GitHub repo, and the link to the deployed app. It also explains the implementations of the app, and screenshots of different pages of the application as well.

P.S.: I will be moving the document's content to the README file soon!
